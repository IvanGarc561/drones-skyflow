1. First pip install yolov8 in terminal with following prompt
pip install ultralytics==8.2.103

2. Download the following zip file titled "datasets.zip" it will contain a data.yaml file plus the dataset with annotations. Unzip this folder.
drive.google.com/file/d/1sihD8NlyA3f2cak2zmRrLMx0Z6yGOq8Y/view?usp=sharing

3. Enter the following command in your terminal but rename the directory to where the datasets folder is: 
yolo task=detect mode=train model=yolov8s.pt data="/Users/pranavgowrish/Downloads/python/datasets"/data.yaml epochs=25 imgsz=800 plots=True

4. Wait until the model finishes training with the dataset. This may take a few hours depending on your GPU. My macbook was extremely slow for this(6+ hours) so I used Google CoLabs instead.

5. When complete you should see this:
Results saved to runs/detect/train
Best model saved to runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt

6. Go to the location and upload the best.pt file to this github folder!

7. THANK YOUUUUUU, this is definitely going to be much faster than roboflow inferences
